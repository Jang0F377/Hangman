# Hangman
  Kotlin ASCII Hangman game. My first foray into Kotlin. Upon starting it asks for your name, after entering, it shows the instructions
  with a little gallows image and asks you to select a difficulty, the difficulty determines how many lives/wrong letters you get.
  10, 8, 6 for Easy, Medium, and Hard respectively. After selecting one, you will be given ? for each letter, begin your guessing!
  

# Technologies used:
 * Kotlin
 
# What did I learn
  Learned to use Kotlin when & do loops and to break functions into smaller chunks to make things more modular and easier to read. Felt very accomplished
  when this came together, my first working Kotlin Project.

  
# Hurdles Overcome
 * understanding how to guess and check if that guess is in the selected word, if it is remove the ? at the correct spot of the guessed letter
 * Using booleans to manage state ex. var playing = true, var winner = false, var lost = false. then setting winner to true, playing to false, etc.
